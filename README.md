# Controlling-Orthotic-Device-using-TFT-LCD
The goal of stroke rehabilitations to help patients relearn the skills 
lost after stroke. Active participation in repetitive exercise is 
important for stroke rehabilitation training. Researches shown that 
stroke patients actively involved in functional tasks can promote 
brain neuroplasticity. The brain is able to rewire the neurological 
pathway of motor function and the patients can gradually restore 
their hand function. The functional recovery of hemiparetic limbs 
can occur and the recovery process can continue even years after 
the brain injury.<br>

## Working
The Robo Rehab made using Arduino IDE controls the working of machine 
designed for robotic rehabilitation for ankle movement control. The Robo Rehab TFT LCD consist of three screens. Through 
which it controls the working of machine designed for robotic 
rehabilitation for ankle movement control. The TFT LCD interacts 
with Arduino Uno.

### SCREEN 1  
When ‘New Patient’ or ‘Existing Patient’ buttons are pressed 
SCREEN 2 is displayed.

### SCREEN 2 
When ‘OK’ button is pressed SCREEN 3 is displayed and when 
‘BACK’ button is pressed SCREEN 1 is displayed.

### SCREEN 3 
When ‘BACK’ button is pressed SCREEN 2 is displayed and ‘OK’ 
button is pressed the code for controlling machine starts running.
